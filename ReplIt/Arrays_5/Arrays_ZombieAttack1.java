/*
An array **inhabitants** represents cities and their respective populations.
For example, the following arrays shows 8 cities and their respective populations:

[3, 6, 0, 4, 3, 2, 7, 1]

Some cities have a population of 0 due to a pandemic zombie disease that is wiping
 out the human lives. After each day, every city will lose half of its population.

Write a program to loop though each city population and make it lose half of its population
**until all cities have no humans left**. Make updates to each element in the array And print
 the array like below for each day:

```
Day 0[3, 6, 0, 4, 3, 2, 7, 1]
Day 1[1, 3, 0, 2, 1, 1, 3, 0]
Day 2 [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
Day 3 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
---- EXTINCT ----
```

Write the program in a way that it will handle any number of people in cities, above was just an example

Hint:

Below expression will print array in this format:

```

System.out.println(Arrays.toString(inhabitants)));

[3, 6, 0, 4, 3, 2, 7, 1]

```
