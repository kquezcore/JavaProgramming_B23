WRITE A FUNCTION:

- That give and integer N(1<N<100), Returns an array containing N unique integers that sum up to 0.

- the function could return [1,0,-3,2] or [-2,1,-4,5]

-- the answer [1,-1,1,3] should be incorrect (because the value 1 occurs twice)

-- for N = 3. one of the possible answers is [-1,0,1] (but there are many more correct answers)
